> - This list is still work in progress!  
> - Unofficially updated = Updated by someone other than the creator
> - All shaders here support Android, iOS, Windows with a single mcpack file, make sure to follow installation guide for your platform (for Android use MB Loader app from Google Play)
> - I intentionally did not include shaders that only have different files for different platforms, as those end up creating more confusion
> - N/A ones are not fully usable yet, so I didn't include link
